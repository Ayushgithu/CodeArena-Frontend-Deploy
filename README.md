⚔️ Code Arena: Coding Battle Platform
Code Arena is a real-time, competitive programming platform designed to facilitate coding and MCQ battles. It features a decoupled, full-stack architecture that supports high-concurrency, low-latency interaction for users participating in coding assessments and competitive rooms.

🚀 Tech Stack
Backend: Java (Spring Boot), Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA, WebSockets (STOMP).

Frontend: React.js (Vite), Axios, Tailwind CSS.

Database & Cache: MySQL, Redis.

Authentication: JWT-based stateless authentication.

🧠 Core Features
Real-time Battle Rooms: Supports multiplayer coding and MCQ battles with WebSocket-based state synchronization.

Adaptive AI Engine: Dynamically selects questions based on difficulty levels and user skill tags.

Sandboxed Code Execution: Secure, integrated backend engine to evaluate user code against test cases.

Real-time Communication: Built-in live chat features for participants within a room.

Performance Analytics: Detailed post-battle feedback, including strength/weakness analysis and leaderboard rankings.

📂 Project Structure
Backend (/cdac-project)
controller/: Manages all REST endpoints and WebSocket messaging (e.g., RoomWebSocketController for battle logic).

entity/: Database models representing core domain objects like User, Room, CodingQuestion, and Submission.

service/ & serviceImpl/: The "brain" of the application.

AdaptiveQuestionSelector: Algorithms to fetch questions tailored to user performance.

CodeExecutionService: Logic to handle code compilation and test case validation.

repository/: Data access layer interfacing with MySQL.

config/: System configuration, including SecurityConfig (JWT filters) and WebSocketConfig (messaging protocols).

dataInitializer/: Initializers to load foundational data (roles, questions) on startup.

Frontend (/code-arena-fe)
pages/: View-level components for different routes (e.g., DashboardPage, CodingRoomPage).

components/: Modular UI elements:

editor/: The code editor environment.

chat/: The real-time messaging component.

room/: Modals for room creation and invitations.

services/: API abstraction layer using Axios to communicate with the Spring Boot backend.

config/: Global configurations, including ApiInterceptor for handling auth headers and session expiration.

🔮 Future Feature Scope

Proctoring-Ready Interview Mode: A specialized interface that restricts window switching, monitors focus, and manages timed assessment constraints.

Collaborative Whiteboard: An integrated digital canvas allowing candidates to sketch algorithms, system designs, or data structures in real-time during an interview.

Live Screen Sharing: Peer-to-peer (P2P) screen-sharing capability built via WebRTC to allow interviewers or proctors to observe the coding process live.

Tournament Mode: Creating bracket-style tournament systems for larger community events.
